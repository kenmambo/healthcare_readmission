    "admission_type_id": 1,
    "time_in_hospital": 5,
    "num_procedures": 1,
    "num_medications": 20,
    "number_diagnoses": 9
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict", json=patient_data)
prediction = response.json()
print(f"Risk Level: {prediction['risk_level']}")
print(f"Probability: {prediction['probability']:.2%}")
