# Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction

Predicts 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients using machine learning.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes diabetic patient data to predict the likelihood of readmission within 30 days of discharge. The goal is to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and optimize care plans.

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Diabetes 130-US Hospitals
- **Size**: 101,766 records, 50 features
- **Target Variable**: `readmitted` (binary: <30 days = 1, else 0)
